        NewsForMe sends you a short news email each day. To do that, we keep a small amount of
        information about you. This page says what we keep, why, and how to remove it.
      </p>

      <Section title="What we keep">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>Your email address. We use it to sign you in and send your brief.</li>
          <li>Your name, role, and the note you write about yourself. These help pick and explain stories.</li>
          <li>Your topics, your chosen sources, your send time, and your time zone.</li>
          <li>Whether your emails are on or paused.</li>
          <li>A log of the briefs we sent you: the date, the subject, and whether it was delivered.</li>
          <li>
            The links included in your recent briefs. We use these so you never get the same story
            twice. We delete them after 45 days.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not ask for your password, phone number, address, or payment details. We do not
          track which links you click.
